This code is for hang man games. Inside this game, we can save our high score in txt file. In our program we use link list, pointer, array, multidemtional array,struct,etc.
When you start the code, first it will show the menu. To play the game we need insert ‘c’. Then it will ask you to insert your name. After that it will show the clue and place to let you guess the answer one alphabet at a time. If you guess 6 times wrong, you will lose. But if not you will win but every time you guess wrong your score will decrease.
